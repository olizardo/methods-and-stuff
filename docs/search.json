    "text": "CA and Tabular Bias\nOftentimes, Simple Correspondence Analysis (hereafter CA) is presented as a complex, almost mystical technique, and its association with a relatively obscure data-analytic school in France and later Bourdieu’s Distinction does not help. This is a pity since CA is actually a quantitative data reduction technique that is perfect for presenting qualitative data. Particularly in data from samples typically seen in work by ethnographers, interviewers, small-sample content analysts, and historical sociologists.\nTypically, these researchers will present key pieces of data in tabular form, and ask the readers to use a lot of brainpower to detect patterns by staring at numbers when it would be much easier to do a simple CA and present the categories in the rows and columns of the table as a biplot of the first two-dimensions of a simple CA. I present three examples from published work showing this “tabular bias” and show how CA could have improved things greatly (and maybe revealed some insights).1 Note that picked these three articles not to drag them, but because I liked them quite a lot, and saw potential for them to be even better than they are.\n\n\nExample I: Journals and Theory Diagrams\n\n    tab <- matrix(c(72, 13, 7, 5, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0, 3, 1, 0, 1, 109, \n             27, 11, 4, 5, 19, 3, 1, 6, 11, 10, 1, 0,\n             110, 34, 14, 3, 14, 24, 1, 0, 3, 9, 10, 0, 0,\n             14, 11, 9, 5, 5, 5, 4, 0, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0,\n             105, 57, 36, 34, 34, 24, 1, 4, 15, 3, 7, 17, 1,\n             162, 13, 5, 6, 6, 9, 3, 0, 2, 6, 2, 3, 0,\n             103, 35, 23, 12, 12, 20, 0, 0, 8, 3, 9, 0, 0), nrow = 7, byrow = TRUE)\n    tab <- tab[, -c(1, 2)] #dropping fist two columns\n    colnames(tab) <- c(\"Arrows\", \"Circles\", \"Boxes\", \"Lines\", \"Triangles\", \n              \"Zig-Zags\", \"Legend\", \"Reading-Rules\", \"Path-Diag.\",\n              \"Venn-Diag.\", \"Con-Circles\")\n    rownames(tab) <- c(\"AJS\", \"ASR\", \"EJS\", \"EJST\", \"ST\", \"TCS\", \"TS\")\n\nIn a fascinating piece, Brett et al. (2020) study the ways sociologists use diagrams to visualize theory ideas. They selected seven primarily or heavily “theoretical” journals in sociology (p. 227), and coded the “theory figures” included in a random sample of papers from each journal. The theory figure codes aimed at specifying what sort of visual languages authors used to construct the visualizations (e.g., boxes, arrows, geometrical figures, Venn diagrams, and the like). The tabular data is presented as an Appendix (A) to the paper. A two-mode table cross-classifying journals by the characteristics of the theory figures they typically publish These data are reproduced in Table 1. The table has seven rows (for the journals) and eleven columns (for the theory figure motifs)\n\n    library(kableExtra)\n    kbl(tab, format = \"html\", align = \"c\", padding = 2) %>% \n        column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%  \n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"))\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Table of journals by theory figure characteristics. \n \n  \n      \n    Arrows \n    Circles \n    Boxes \n    Lines \n    Triangles \n    Zig-Zags \n    Legend \n    Reading-Rules \n    Path-Diag. \n    Venn-Diag. \n    Con-Circles \n  \n \n\n  \n    AJS \n    7 \n    5 \n    3 \n    5 \n    0 \n    0 \n    0 \n    3 \n    1 \n    0 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    ASR \n    11 \n    4 \n    5 \n    19 \n    3 \n    1 \n    6 \n    11 \n    10 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJS \n    14 \n    3 \n    14 \n    24 \n    1 \n    0 \n    3 \n    9 \n    10 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    EJST \n    9 \n    5 \n    5 \n    5 \n    4 \n    0 \n    0 \n    2 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    ST \n    36 \n    34 \n    34 \n    24 \n    1 \n    4 \n    15 \n    3 \n    7 \n    17 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    TCS \n    5 \n    6 \n    6 \n    9 \n    3 \n    0 \n    2 \n    6 \n    2 \n    3 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    TS \n    23 \n    12 \n    12 \n    20 \n    0 \n    0 \n    8 \n    3 \n    9 \n    0 \n    0 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bulk of Brett et al.’s paper is concerned with specific examples, and the point is to delve into these to diagnose various problems in the ways sociologists use theory pictures (and end with some really good advice). Brett et al. were not concerned with the relationship between different journals and theory figure motifs, although they could have presented such data in a clear way by using a CA visualization of the table presented in the appendix. This is shown in Figure 1.\n\n    library(FactoMineR)\n    ca.res <- CA(tab)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: CA Visualization of the table of journals by theory figure characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe Figure shows that the distribution of theory figure motifs across theory journals is not random, which would be hard to tell from eyeballing the numbers in Table 1. Indeed, there is a pattern across journals, separating, on the main horizontal dimension, the American Sociological Review (ASR) and the European Journal of Sociology (EJS) on the one end from Sociological Theory (ST) at the other end. ASR and EJS are awash in lines and path diagrams, while ST traffics heavily in circles (concentric and otherwise), zig-zags, boxes, and Venn diagrams. The American Journal of Sociology (AJS), square in the middle, balances between these two tendencies. On the other hand, the second dimension separates the European Journal of Social Theory (EJST), which somehow gravitates towards triangles, from Theory & Society, which likes legends. The arrows theory figure motif is neutral across journals, being placed close to the origin of the plot.2\n\n\nExample 2: Early Modern Authors in Economics\nErikson & Hamilton (2018)—hereafter EH—discuss how early modern economic thought arose from the practical reflections of people directly involved in trade, particularly international trade. As evidence consistent with this claim, they argue that authors of early modern economics texts were disproportionately more likely to be recruited from certain classes, trades, and stations (e.g., merchants, especially those involved in international trade in chartered companies) as compared to others (Gentry, Army types). This merchant connection is supposed to strengthen over time (going from the sixteenth into the seventeenth century).\n\n    d <- c(0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0,\n            0, 1, 2, 0, 14, 2, 1,\n            3, 4, 9, 1, 32, 6, 1,\n            4, 10, 16, 7, 35, 15, 2,\n            14, 38, 28, 22, 66, 38, 3,\n            22, 48, 40, 28, 103, 68, 11,\n            41, 49, 47, 12, 126, 65, 22,\n            123, 94, 97, 5, 222, 255, 3,\n            56, 48, 63, 5, 151, 205, 7\n            )\n    d <- t(matrix(d, nrow = 7, ncol = 9))\n    rownames(d) <- c(\"1550\", \"1570\", \"1590\", \"1610\", \"1630\", \"1650\", \"1670\", \"1690\", \"1710\") \n    colnames(d) <- c(\"Noble\", \"Gentry\", \"Clergy\", \"Military\", \"Professional\", \"Merchant\", \"Yeoman\")\n\n    kbl(d, format = \"html\", align = \"c\", padding = 2) %>% \n        column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%  \n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"))\n\n\n\nTable 2:  Table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors. \n \n  \n      \n    Noble \n    Gentry \n    Clergy \n    Military \n    Professional \n    Merchant \n    Yeoman \n  \n \n\n  \n    1550 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n    0 \n    1 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    1570 \n    0 \n    1 \n    2 \n    0 \n    14 \n    2 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1590 \n    3 \n    4 \n    9 \n    1 \n    32 \n    6 \n    1 \n  \n  \n    1610 \n    4 \n    10 \n    16 \n    7 \n    35 \n    15 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    1630 \n    14 \n    38 \n    28 \n    22 \n    66 \n    38 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1650 \n    22 \n    48 \n    40 \n    28 \n    103 \n    68 \n    11 \n  \n  \n    1670 \n    41 \n    49 \n    47 \n    12 \n    126 \n    65 \n    22 \n  \n  \n    1690 \n    123 \n    94 \n    97 \n    5 \n    222 \n    255 \n    3 \n  \n  \n    1710 \n    56 \n    48 \n    63 \n    5 \n    151 \n    205 \n    7 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA key piece of evidence in this regard is presented in two-mode tabular form (Table 7, p. 140), reproduced here as Table Table 2. The table cross-classifies ten time periods by seven classes of economics authors. EH invite the reader to gaze at the numbers to reach the desired conclusion (e.g, that there are more merchants in later periods). I argue that the reader would have reached the conclusion faster and would have been even more convinced of their argument if they had used CA to present the results of their cross-classification. The reader may have also noticed patterns that are impossible to see by staring at the table. This is shown in Figure 2.\n\n    ca.res <- CA(d)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: CA Visualization of the table of time periods by classes of early modern economics authors.\n\n\n\n\nThe figure shows evidence consistent with EH’s claims. Indeed, Merchants end up near the upper-left-hand quadrant of the two-dimensional space, nearer the last two periods (1690-1710), indicating that they dominated the discussion during this era. They are maximally contrasted with authors with a military background (who are naturally better represented in more bellicose periods) and authors with a Yeoman background (who are better represented in the late sixteenth century). The CA also reveals insights not evident in the tabular presentation. First, Noblemen were also better represented among economics authors in the later period, even if they were less numerous than merchants. Second, clergymen are more or less evenly represented across periods, ending close to the plot’s origins.\n\n\nExample 3: Relationship Between Class and Mode of Aesthetic Self-Presentation\nIn a fascinating paper, van den Haak and Wilterdink (2019)—hereafter HW—analyze interview data from a sample of ninety Dutch people more or less evenly divided into three groups by class situation: Stayers in the less educated stratum, stayers in the more educated stratum, and movers from the low to the high educated stratum. HW asked these people about their cultural tastes, other people’s cultural tastes, and whether there was such a thing as good or bad taste.\n\n    d <- matrix(c(2, 5, 1, 6, 3, 13, 22, 20, 13, 0, 2, 3), \n                nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE)\n    rownames(d) <- c(\"Only hierarchical\", \"Only egalitarian\", \n                    \"Both: ambivalent\", \"Neither: neutral\")\n    colnames(d) <- c(\"Stayers (High Educ.)\", \"Movers (Low to High)\", \"Stayers (Less Educ.)\")\n    d <- t(d)\n    kbl(d, format = \"html\", align = \"c\", padding = 2) %>% \n            column_spec(1, bold = TRUE) %>%  \n    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"hover\", \"condensed\", \"responsive\"))\n\n\n\nTable 3:  Class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation. \n \n  \n      \n    Only hierarchical \n    Only egalitarian \n    Both: ambivalent \n    Neither: neutral \n  \n \n\n  \n    Stayers (High Educ.) \n    2 \n    6 \n    22 \n    0 \n  \n  \n    Movers (Low to High) \n    5 \n    3 \n    20 \n    2 \n  \n  \n    Stayers (Less Educ.) \n    1 \n    13 \n    13 \n    3 \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you might imagine, this interview schedule resulted in a lot of “who am I to judge,” “to each their own,” “I wouldn’t want to sound rude,” and so forth. But the surprising thing is that HW also found that some non-substantial minority was unafraid to be judgy while the bulk of their sample shifted between judgy and “who am I…” discourses sometimes in the middle of the same thought!\nSo HW went back and coded their interview data (divided into the aforementioned classes) into different aesthetic self-presentation groups: People unafraid to produce hierarchical judgments of taste (e.g., “this type of culture is better than that other”), people who consistently stuck to the “who am I…, and to each…” script (egalitarians), and people who wavered between these two (ambivalents). There was also a neutral category for those who didn’t use any of these discourses.\n\n    ca.res <- CA(d)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: CA Visualization of the table of class status by mode of aesthetic self-presentation.\n\n\n\n\nHW presented their results in (their) Table 1 (p. 422), reproduced here (rows and columns switched) as Table 3. In summarizing their results, HW note that “[a]s Table 1 specifies, the well-educated are clearly over-represented in the hierarchical type and the (much larger) category of the ambivalent type, whereas the less-educated make up larger proportions of the egalitarian and the neutral categories (p. 422).” This is definitely what the table shows, but it is not as evident as HW think because, well, table. A CA of the table would show the result in a better way. Moreover, CA is particularly efficient at summarizing results of two-way tables with a relatively small number of cases like Table 3.\nThe results are shown in Figure 3. Indeed, stayers among the educated stratum are the most likely to use the ambivalent discourse in HW’s data. In the same way, stayers in the less educated stratum are more consistently egalitarian (in nuanced ways that are better detailed in the paper) and closer to the neutral pole (upper-right quadrant).\nHowever, what the CA plot also shows that is not that evident in the table is that movers into the educated stratum are also the most consistently hierarchical, perhaps in line with Bourdieu’s original thesis that latecomers into cultural capital tend to adopt the party line in more rigid and less flexible forms—as detailed in Lizardo (2018).\n\n\nConclusion\nRhetorically, sociology is way past the “methods wars” that characterized the bad old days. Mixed methods are quite normal, and people are used to deploying strategies that cross the qual/quant divide to answer questions and present data. Yet, some practices are encrusted in tradition, particularly using tabular data to present results. Both qualitative and quantitative people use them, but most of the time, a picture will be better.\nOne reason is that a two-way, two-mode table is a many-dimensional object (with as many dimensions as cells in the underlying matrix represented in the table). It needs some dimensionality reduction to be made comprehensible. People often reduce the dimensions informally (directing the reader’s attention to a particular column or percentage cell), but that means they are bound to miss non-obvious patterns.\nCA can be used for many purposes, but the two things it is really good at are (1) reducing dimensionality usually to \\(d = 2\\), and (2) visualizing this reduction in a synoptic diagram (what Bourdieu loved about it). This preserves cognitive economy and maximizes impact. In the olden days, CA was an obscure method ensconced in obscure software (if available at all). Today, it is just a click away from the interface in all the popular data analysis programs (like R in the present case).\nSo whenever the urge to present something as a table occurs, especially at a key point in a paper, ask yourself: Wouldn’t CA tell a better story here? I bet, in most cases, it will.\n\n\nReferences\nBrett, G., Silver, D., & Beelen,, K. (2020). The right tool for the job: problems and solutions in visualizing sociological theory.

    "text": "In a chapter on the subject of “culture and networks” for the second edition of the Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis (edited by Peter J. Carrington, John McLevey, and John Scott)—see here—I argue that there intimate links between recent work on cultural networks, duality, and cultural holes, and recent work in the categories literature dealing with fuzziness of categorization, atypicality, and variety in cultural choices.\nThis conceptual linkage is one that was initially noted and developed by Balazs Kocavs in a couple of papers (see here and here) in the early 2010s, but which has not been pursued or developed of late. This is despite the fact that work on categories pursues relentless mathematical formalization, but in a language and style that either obscure or do not make very intuitive its link to formal approaches in the cultural networks tradition based on the ideas of duality and two-mode network analysis (Mützel & Breiger, 2020).\nIn the chapter I argue that particularly that the various conceptual distinctions and measures proposed in Goldberg et al.’s 2016 paper on category atypicality variety, and cultural boundary spanning can be given a familiar representation using tools from the analysis of cultural networks. The argument in the chapter is mostly informal. The purpose of this post is to provide a more formal treatment and extension of some of the ideas discussed in the chapter."

    "text": "Culture, Networks, Objects, Labels\nThe first observation is that the main difference between typical categories studies and studies of cultural networks is that while the latter usual deal with a two-mode network of people by the objects they choose (in which the “objects” can sometimes be categories themselves, like the typical people X genres network studied by sociologists of tastes), categories research differentiate between particular objects (this restaurant, this film, this piece of music) and the category labels that some external audiences imposed on those object to classify them or group them (see Goldberg et al. 2016, p. 222).\nSo while the usual cultural networks study deals with a two-mode network of people by objects chosen (\\(\\mathbf{A}\\)) of dimensions \\(P \\times O\\), categories research split the analysis and measurement tasks across two distinct two-networks: \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), and a second object by labels network (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) of dimensions \\(O \\times L\\)."

    "text": "The Label Space and Atypicality\nIt is easy to see that the main concepts developed by Goldberg et al. in the 2016 ASR paper (and previously Hannan and Kovacs in a 2015 Sociological Science piece) have ready-made representations in terms of two-mode network metrics.\nTake for, instance, the idea that the category structure of a domain can be captured by “geometrically” representing the cultural space (as defined by the labels). This requires coming up with a criterion for defining interlabel distances, which are themselves based on some criterion for interlabel similarity.\nIn terms of two-mode network analysis, this boils down to taking the one mode projection of the (\\(\\mathbf{B}\\)) matrix:\n\\[\n     LL = B^TB\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe square matrix \\(\\mathbf{LL}\\) contains the number of objects shared by each pair of labels \\((i,j)\\) in the off-diagonals, and the number of objects covered by each label in the diagonals. The Jaccard (J) similarity measure proposed by Goldberg et al. (eq. 1) is a function of these quantities, and thus can be written as:\n\\[     \n     J_{ij} = \\frac{LL_{ij}}{LL_{ii} + L_{jj} - LL_{ij}}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nBut of course, so are many other measures of similarity, such as Cosine, Dice, min-overlap, max-overlap, and the like. All can be defined from quantities obtained from the one-mode label \\(\\times\\) label network obtained from the projection of the original object \\(\\times\\) label network.\nOnce we have a measure of similarity, inter-label distances are obtained by some transformation of label similarities, such that similar objects are close and dissimilar objects are far (Goldberg et al. use a negative exponential function due to Shepard). Distances, in this sense, are derivative of quantities obtained from the one-mode network projection."

    "text": "Defining Object Atypicality\nHaving obtained inter-label similarity (distance) information, we can then loop back and define an object’s atypicality based on their likelihood of being assigned dissimilar (distant) labels. Conversely typical objects are those that are assigned similar (close) labels.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Cultural ego networks of typical and atypical objects.\n\n\nThus, if we think of each object as having an “object ego-network” (see Figure 1) where the “alters” are the labels assigned to it, the typicality/atypicality is purely a function of the weighted density of the alter-alter network surrounding ego, where the weight of the tie between alters is given by the label similarities (or distances). So, when the weights are similarities, typical objects have high “constraint” in their cultural ego network—in Burt’s sense as defined by Lizardo (2014)—with their label alters strongly linked to one another. Atypical objects, on the other hand have low constraint, with their label alters weakly tied to one another. So this is another way of saying that atypical objects span cultural holes in the interlabel network (see Figure 1)."

That’s exactly what Goldberg et al. do, but they don’t characterize it quite that way.\nSo, people’s taste for variety is just the average atypicality of the objects they choose, suitably weighted by their rating of the object if such information is available (see Goldberg et al. eq. 7), such that only objects for which the person displays a positive (after sampling) evaluation count."

Basically, the idea is that variety seeking can be measured using information on “the average distance of the objects consumed [by people] and that variety seeking means liking pairs of objects that stand far apart in the cultural space” (Goldberg et al. 2016, p. 224).\nHere Goldberg et al. get into some over-complication territory, since they insist on using “cultural space” information to define the inter-object similarities (distances). But then get hung up on the fact that sometimes the label set sizes of different objects are not the same (in our terms, objects cultural ego network sizes are different), and they want to compare distances across sets of different sizes and so forth to define inter-object distances.\nOddly, they ignore the lowest hanging fruit to defining inter-object similarities (and by implication distances). Had they been more attuned to the principle of duality they would have realized they actually had two choices:\n\\[     \n     OO_1 = A^TA\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\n     OO_2 = BB^T\n\\tag{4}\\]\nMatrix \\(OO_1\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on audience overlap. Matrix \\(OO_2\\) would contain the basic quantities to compute inter-object similarities based on inter-label overlap. The first approach is the one pursued by Lizardo (2014) for cultural object genre labels. Goldberg et al. use label distance information to define the inter-object similarity (distance) network, which is fine, so they opt for a complicated version of the projection approach, based on set theoretic distance measures between the label sets assigned to each pair of objects that account for different sizes across the pairs of sets being compared.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Varieties of monism.\n\n\nA more straightforward approach based on duality—like that pursued by Kovacs (2010) in other work—would have just said that objects are (similar) distant in cultural space to the extent they get assigned overlapping (different) labels. Any of the similarity measures (Jaccard, cosine, Dice) applied pairwise to the cells of the \\(OO_2\\) matrix would have yielded that information in a more intuitive way that Goldberg et al’s “modified Hausdorff distance” (Goldberg et al., eqs. 8-9) approach."

    "text": "The Taste for Variety\nIn any case, once an interobject similarity (distance) network is obtained (preferably by the simpler duality approach), then we can loop back to the people and define their taste for variety similarly to how atypicality is defined for objects (this is what Goldberg et al. ultimately end up doing too).\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Strong poly-purism.\n\n\nPeople who seek variety have a cultural ego-network surrounded by objects who are themselves dissimilar (get assigned non-overlapping labels); people who don’t seek variety consume objects who get assigned overlapping labels. Thus, people bridge cultural holes in the variety sense, when they consume categorically distinct pairs of objects.\nUltimately, we can see why Goldberg et al.’s approach yields empirically and analytically distinct measures of boundary spanning based on atypicality-seeking and variety-seeking. In the atypicality case, even an “univore” can cross cultural boundaries, by consuming a single atypical object, like riot grrrl jazz (mono-mixer). In the same way an expansive “omnivore” in terms of volume of choices can fail to span boundaries, by consuming many categorically indistinct objects. Of course, both strategies can be combined yielding a second way to span boundaries, consuming many atypical objects (poly-mixer); finally, a person can like variety while abhorring atypicality yielding yet a third way of crossing boundaries (poly-purist).\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Weak poly-purism.\n\n\nWe can represent these distinct consumer types using the proposed three-mode network imagery. For instance, the different types of “mono” consumers (people with a relatively low taste for variety) are shown in Figure 2. The “mono-mixer” (Figure 2 (a)) is a person who chooses one, albeit highly atypical, genre as given by the low similarity between the labels assigned to it. So while they connect to only a single object, they indirectly connect to multiple (weakly related) labels via that object.\nThe mono-purist comes in two flavors (only implicitly distinguished in Goldberg et al.). The first (Figure 2 (b)) is the “purest” mono-purist: A person who chooses objects most representative of their types (single-labeled objects). Then there is a relatively weaker form of mono-purism: Picking a multi-labeled object whose labels are strongly related to one another (Figure 2 (c)).\nThe same approach can be used to distinguish between different forms of poly-purism. First, there is the strong poly-purist (Figure 3), who only consumes (and likes) objects that are the strongest representatives of their categories, as given by their single label assignment, and the relative dissimilarities between labels across objects consumed. Then there is a weaker form of poly-purism (Figure 4); a consumer who would countenance multi-labeled objects, as long as they are still typical members of their categories, as given by the strong similarities between the labels assigned, and the relative dissimilarities across label sets between objects (a similar approach could be used to define strong and weak varieties of poly-mixing)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOverall, it is clear that the analysis of categories, typicality, and variety is set squarely in the same ballpark as the traditional analysis of cultural networks (DiMaggio, 2011). The move to a multimode case (featuring people \\(\\times\\) objects and objects \\(\\times\\) labels networks), and the reticence of categories researchers to use formal tools from the analysis of duality and cultural holes, has obscured some of these commonalities. Hopefully they have become a bit clearer here.\n\nReferences\nGoldberg, A., Hannan, M. T., & Kovács, B. (2016). What does it mean to span cultural boundaries?
